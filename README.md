# Austin Bikeshare Dataset Analysis
***
Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree Project


## Installation
The code is intended to be run with Python 3.6+ and is dependent on several libraries. To install these libraries, execute:
> pip install -r requirements.txt
or 
> conda install --file requirements.txt
in a specified conda environment, if you use conda.

The data used in this analysis, Austin Bikeshare and Austin Weather are included in this repo but, can be downloaded [here](https://www.kaggle.com/jboysen/austin-bike) and [here](https://www.kaggle.com/grubenm/austin-weather).

## Project Motivation
This is an Udacity Nanodegree project. I choose to analyze the Austin Bikeshare and Austin Weather datasets to analayze following questions:
1. "How do weather conditions affect bike share usage?"
2. "How does bike share usage vary across multiple subscriber types?"
3. "What was the traffic distribution across the various stations in the network?"


## File Description
* **plots/**:  Created plots to be included in the blog post
* **data/**: Directory containing the .csv, austin bikeshare and austin weather datasets, as well as shape files used for plotting.
* **BikeShare.ipynb**: Notebook containing the data analysis
* **requirements.txt**: Environment dependent libraries
